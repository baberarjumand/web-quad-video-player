# QuadVideoPlayer

A web app that can play 4 video files simaltaineously in the browser. This app was developed in answer to personal frustration with the Awesome Video Player constantly crashing on one of my PCs.<br>

In it's current implementation, four videos are on screen. If the videos are 1920x1080 (or similar aspect ratio), they cover the whole screen on 1920x1080 resolution when in fullscreen mode.<br>

This app can very well be configured to show 'x' number of screens in any desirable layout that can be achieved with Bootstrap.<br>
